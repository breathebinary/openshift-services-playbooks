// Copy this file to /etc/bind/named.conf if you want to run bind as an
// authoritative nameserver. If you want to run a recursive DNS resolver
// instead, see /etc/bind/named.conf.recursive.
//
// BIND supports using the same daemon as both authoritative nameserver and
// recursive resolver; it supports this because it is the oldest and original
// nameserver and so was designed before it was realized that combining these
// functions is inadvisable.
//
// In actual fact, combining these functions is a very bad idea. It is thus
// recommended that you run a given instance of BIND as either an authoritative
// nameserver or recursive resolver, not both. The example configuration herein
// provides a secure starting point for running an authoritative nameserver.
